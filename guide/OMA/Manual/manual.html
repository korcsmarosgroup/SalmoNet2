</a><p>The OMA (Orthologous MAtrix) database is a 
            well-established resource for identifying orthologs among publicly 
            available complete genomes. Orthologs are genes that are related 
            through speciation events, and are essential for many analyses, 
            including gene function prediction and species tree 
            reconstruction.</p>
<p>OMA standalone is a standalone package that can 
            infer orthologs using the OMA algorithm on custom genomes. It is 
            also possible to export genomes and their homology relations 
            directly from the OMA web-browser and combine them with custom 
            genomes or proteomes.</p>
<p>OMA standalone computes pairwise orthologs and 
            constructs from those two different types of groupings, the OMA 
            Groups and Hierarchical Orthologous Groups (HOGs). Furthermore, 
            OMA standalone can predict gene function annotations using Gene 
            Ontology terms based on existing annotations from exported 
            genomes, and produces phyletic profiles for OMA Groups and HOGs.  
            See section <a href="#applications">Possible applications</a> for some further explanations how to use the output of OMA 
            standalone.</p>
<p><a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> provides
            an overview of the OMA standalone pipeline together with user input 
            and output files that are produced by OMA standalone.</p>

<p>You can run OMA as a standalone program on your own 
            computer or HPC cluster. Included are the algorithms for OMA itself 
            plus ESPRIT - a tool based on OMA to detect split genes.
            The software can be run on Linux (x86, both 64bit and 32bit) and 
            MacOSX (x86, 64bit).</p>
<p>A good introduction into OMA standalone is provided in
            the following article:</p>
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.243212.118">Altenhoff et al. OMA standalone: orthology inference among public 
                and custom genomes and transcriptomes. Genome Research, 2019, 29:1152-1163</a> Please cite this article if you are using OMA standalone for your 
            analysis</p>
<p>For a short summary and pointers to detailed algorithmic 
            publications of OMA, please refer to the OMA browser page:</p>

<p>For background info on ESPRIT, 
            please refer to this article:</p>

<p>If you have specific questions about the installation 
            or the usage of OMA, please contact 
            adrian.altenhoff <i>at</i>
 inf.ethz.ch or christophe.dessimoz <i>at</i>
 unil.ch.</p>
<a name="downloads"><h1>Downloads</h1>
</a><p>The current version of OMA standalone can be 
                found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://omabrowser.org/standalone/OMA.2.5.0.tgz">OMA.2.5.0.tgz</a></p>
<p>See the <a href="release_notes.txt">release notes</a> to get an overview of recent function improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p><a href="previous_releases.html">Previous releases</a> of OMA standalone are still available for download.</p>
<a name="installation"><h1>Installation</h1>
</a><p>You do not need to install OMA standalone on your
            system; the script will also run if you just call it by using 
            the complete path to <tt>bin/oma</tt>
 in the installer folder. 
            But we still encourage you to run the installer script, since it 
            makes working with OMA considerably more convenient.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we now also provide a docker container that
            can be used directly. See the<a href="#docker">Docker section</a> for additional information on this.</p>
<p>To install OMA standalone on your system, download
            the installer, untar the package and run the included installer
            script:</p>
<p><pre>wget -O oma.tgz https://omabrowser.org/standalone/OMA.2.5.0.tgz
# on MacOS you can also use curl: 
# curl https://omabrowser.org/standalone/OMA.2.5.0.tgz -o oma.tgz
tar xvzf oma.tgz
cd OMA.2.5.0
./install.sh /your/install/prefix</pre>
</p>
<p>If you do not choose an install prefix, OMA will be 
            installed in <tt>/usr/local/OMA</tt>
 (for this, you might need 
            to install it using the root account or <tt>sudo</tt>
).</p>
<p>After installation, make sure the <tt>bin</tt>
 folder of OMA is in your <tt>PATH</tt>
 variable, e.g., if
            you are using bash and used <tt>/your/install/prefix</tt>
 as
            installer prefix, add a line in <tt>~/.bash_profile</tt>
 such as:</p>
<p><pre>export PATH=$PATH:/your/install/prefix/OMA/bin</pre>
</p>
<p>For other shells, choose the appropriate syntax. Of 
            course you can also just use absolute paths to run OMA standalone.</p>
<h2>Homebrew/Linuxbrew</h2>
<p>Alternatively, OMA standalone is also available on <i>Homebrew</i>
 and <i>Linuxbrew</i>
. To install 
            OMA standalone with Homebrew or Linuxbrew make sure you have 
            installed the respective package and then run <pre>brew tap brewsci/bio
brew install oma</pre>
</p>
<a name="docker"><h2>Docker / Singularity</h2>
</a><p>Alternatively you can also use a docker / singularity container
            to run OMA standalone in any environment that allows running containers. You 
            need to bind mount the folder with your dataset into the docker's <tt>/oma</tt>
 path, i.e. assuming you want to run the ToyExample with the genomes in <tt>/tmp/OMA/ToyExample/DB/*fa</tt>
, you would need to execute the following
            command to download and execute OMA standalone:</p>
<p><pre>docker run --rm --name oma -v &quot;/tmp/OMA/ToyExample:/oma&quot; \
      dessimozlab/oma_standalone:latest oma</pre>
</p>
<p>This would generate the output files as specified in 
            the default parameters file in <tt>/tmp/OMA/ToyExample/Output/</tt>
. You can also pass the usual command line arguments as described 
            below.</p>
<p>On HPC, usually you will need to convert the docker container to a singularity
            container. The following command will convert the OMA standalone docker 
            container from dockerhub to a local singularity image file:</p>
<pre>singularity build --fakeroot omastandalone.sif docker://dessimozlab/oma_standalone</pre>
<p>The container can then be run with a similar command as the docker instance:</p>
<pre>singularity run --bind /tmp/OMA/ToyExample:/oma omastandalone.sif oma</pre>
<a name="usage"><h1>Usage</h1>
</a><p>First, set up a working directory. Copy the file <tt>parameters.drw</tt>
 into this folder (if you installed OmaStandalone,
        you can alternatively run <tt>OMA -p</tt>
 to get the parameter file
        with default values) and change it to your needs. 
        Create a directory <tt>DB</tt>
 in your working directory that holds 
        the genome data in FASTA format (see "<a href="#fileformats">File formats</a>") and copy your 
        data into this directory. If you want to use ESPRIT, the FASTA file 
        containing the contigs should be called <tt>{YourGenome}.contig.fa</tt>
. Then, simply call <tt>OMA</tt>
 from your working directory to 
        run OMA or ESPRIT</p>
<p>If you have not installed OMA yet, use the complete
        path to <tt>bin/oma</tt>
 in the installer folder to start the
        script.</p>
<p>As an example, assume you installed <tt>OMA</tt>
 in <tt>/your/install/prefix</tt>
 and want to use ESPRIT on two genome 
        files and one file with contigs (all in <tt>/home/you/fasta</tt>
, do something like this:</p>
<p><pre># create working directory
mkdir myWorkingDir
cd myWorkingDir
# create DB directory in working directory
mkdir DB
# copy FASTA files into DB directory
cp /home/you/fasta/yourFirstGenomeFile.fa DB/
cp /home/you/fasta/yourSecondGenomeFile.fa DB/
cp /home/you/fasta/yourContigFile.contig.fa DB/
# generate default parameter file
OMA -p
# adjust parameters
vim parameters.drw
# run OMA
OMA</pre>
</p>
<p>To get a first impression of <tt>OMA</tt>
 you 
        could <tt>cd</tt>
 into the <tt>ToyExample</tt>
 directory, 
        have a look at <tt>parameters.drw</tt>
 and run <tt>OMA</tt>
 to process our tiny example files.</p>
<p>Most default parameters have sensible default values. One 
        important exception is the <tt>OutgroupSpecies</tt>
 parameter (added 
        in OMA standalone release 2.4.0), which needs to be set by the user if 
        you do want to infer Hierarchical Orthologous Groups (HOGs) and also 
        the species tree (parameter <tt>SpeciesTree</tt>
 set to <tt>estimate</tt>
). Analyses of HOGs are very sensitive to 
        errors in the species tree rooting, which motivated us to deliberately 
        not provide a default value for this parameter.</p>
<a name="commandlineoptions"><h2>Command-line options</h2>
</a><p>OMA standalone has a few commandline options you can set. 
        The available options together with a brief description is available using 
        the "-h" option, i.e. <tt>OMA -h</tt>
<pre>OMA -h
bin/oma - runs OMA standalone

bin/oma [options] [paramfile]

Runs the standalone version of the Orthologous MAtrix (OMA) pipeline
to infer orthologs among complete genomes. A highlevel description
of its algorithm is available here: http://omabrowser.org/oma/about

The all-against-all Smith-Waterman alignment step of OMA requires 
a lot of CPU time. OMA standalone can therefore be run in parallel.
If you intend to use OMA standalone on a HPC cluster with a scheduler
such as LSF, PBS Pro, Slurm or SunGridEngine, you should use the 
jobarray option of those systems,
e.g. bsub -J &quot;oma[1-500]&quot; bin/oma (on LSF).
     qsub -t 1-500 bin/oma (on SunGridEngine)
In case you run OMA on a single computer with several cores, use 
the -n option.

Options:
  -n &lt;number&gt;   number of parallel jobs to be started on this computer
  -v            version
  -d &lt;level&gt;    increase debug info to &lt;level&gt;. By default level is set to 1.
  -i            interactive session, do not quit in case of error and at the end
                of the run.
  -s            stop after the AllAll phase. This is the part which is parallelized.
                The option can be useful on big datasets that require lot of 
                memory for the later phases of OMA. It allows to stop after the 
                parallelized step and restart again a single process with more
                memory.
  -c            stop after database conversion. This option is useful if you 
                work with a large dataset and/or the filesystem you use is 
                slow. 
  -W &lt;secs&gt;     maximum amount of Wall-clock time (in secs) that the job should
                run before terminating in a clean way. This option has only an 
                effect in the all-against-all phase. If the job terminates
                because it reaches the time limit, it quits with the exit
                code 99.
  -p            copy the default parameter file to the current directory. This
                is useful if want to analyse a new dataset and previously 
                installed OmaStandalone.
  -h/?          this help

paramfile       path to the parameter file. it defaults to ./parameters.drw


EXIT
   0            normal exit
   1            a general error (i.e. configuration problem) occured
  99            reached timelimit (provided with -W flag)</pre>
</p>
<a name="resources"><h2>Required Resources</h2>
</a><p>Depending on the dataset to be analysed, OMA can require
        quite a significant amount of computational resources, i.e. RAM and cpu
        time. Most computing time is spent to compute the all-against-all
        sequence alignments, which is why this part has been parallelized.
        Although cpu intensive this phase does not require too much memory. As
        a rule of thumb you can assume it requires roughly 10 times the size of
        your DB folder, but at minimum 650MB. The second part of OMA runs sequential on a single
        core, but it requires a lot more memory: Asymptotically it grows quadratic 
        in the number of genomes. From a few real data runs we estimated that as a rule of thumb,
        you should count with <tt>400MB * pow(nr_genomes, 1.4)</tt>
. Obviously this
        depends also a lot on the size of your genomes. 60 metazoas have been
        successfully computed using 120GB, and for the same number of bacterial
        genomes, 50GB were reported to be enough.</p>
<p>Because of this imbalance regarding the required memory
        the OMA starter script has command line option <tt>-s</tt>
 to run
        only the first part of the OMA pipeline. Using this option, the
        computation can be split into a parallel phase with little memory 
        requirement , and a single process requiring a lot more RAM. Running 
        the OMA thus becomes a two stage process like this:<pre>
# first stage, little memory:
OMA -s 

# once first stage terminated, run second stage
OMA</pre>
Note that this staging is mostly useful on computing clusters where 
        often memory and cpu time has to be reserved at job submission.</p>
<a name="parallelization"><h2>Parallelization</h2>
</a><p>The all-against-all phase of OMA is the most time-consuming one, but it can be parallelized (unlike all other steps, which cannot run in parallel). The way it works is that the parameter "<tt>AlignBatchSize</tt>
" and the total number of genomes (n) will determine into how many chunks the all-against-all phase is divided. AlignBatchSize will split the n*(n-1)/2 genome pairs further into chunks of at most "<tt>AlignBatchSize</tt>
" alignments. The larger AlignBatchSize is, the fewer (and hence longer)
        jobs will be executed.</p>
<p>Scheduling is straightforward: all compute 
        processes need to start from the same directory, and each one will try to 
        do an equal amount of chunks sequentially. However, before starting a new 
        chunk, each process ensures that it has not yet already been processed
        by another process (i.e. no result file yet exists).</p>
<p>On a single computer with multiple processors and/or cores, it is recomended to start "N" parallel processes with the "-n" option, i.e.<pre>OMA -n 5</pre>
 will start 5 parallel jobs. Note that on HPC with schedulers there is a better way described <a href="#schedulers">below</a></p>
<p>Therefore, there is not need to specify which parts are 
        to be done by which process. One should only ensure that all processes 
        start from a shared directory, such that each chunk gets 
        computed by a single process only.</p>
<a name="schedulers"><h3>Parallelization with LSF, PBS Pro, Slurm, or SunGridEngine</h3>
</a><p>With a scheduler such as LSF, SGE or Slurm, running parallel jobs is particularly easy,
        as the parallel jobs can be start using as a job array. OMA will 
        automatically spread the work for the all-against-all among all processes.
        For a brief discussion on the required resources refer to the section <a href="#resources">below</a>
        Do not start OMA with the -n option for that. Instead, use a job 
        array with one of the supported schedulers below (the example is to 
        start 100 jobs in parallel).</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">New in 2.0: </font>The user should now explicitly set the number of
        total processes that should run in the job array. This is done by setting the environment
        variable <tt>'NR_PROCESSES'.</tt>
 E.g. in bash/tcsh use<pre>export NR_PROCESSES=100  # bash
setenv NR_PROCESSES 100  # tcsh</pre>
 prior to submitting the job. The main advantage of this new form is that single jobs 
        can be more easily resubmitted, and very large job arrays that do not all run simultaneously 
        will work more reliably.</p>
<a name="LSF"><h3>LSF</h3>
</a><p><pre>export NR_PROCESSES=100
bsub -J &quot;OMA[1-$NR_PROCESSES]&quot; -o &quot;out.%I&quot; &quot;OMA&quot;</pre>
</p>
<a name="SGE"><h3>Sun Grid Engine (aka Oracle Grid Engine)</h3>
</a><p><pre>export NR_PROCESSES=100
qsub -t 1-$NR_PROCESSES &quot;OMA&quot;</pre>
</p>
<a name="PBSPro"><h3>PBS Pro</h3>
</a><p>Prepare a job script called e.g. job.sh:<pre>
#!/bin/bash
# set the number of nodes and processes per node
#PBS -l select=1:ncpus=1:mem=1000mb
# set max wallclock time
#PBS -l walltime=01:00:00
#PBS -J 1-100
export NR_PROCESSES=100
OMA</pre>
The script can then be submitted as follows:<pre>qsub job.sh</pre>
</p>
<a name="Slurm"><h3>Slurm</h3>
</a><p><pre>sbatch --array=1-100 -N1 &lt;&lt;EOF
#!/bin/sh 
export NR_PROCESSES=100
/absolute/path/to/bin/OMA
EOF</pre>
</p>
<a name="Adding/Updating new genomes"><h2>Adding/Updating new genomes</h2>
</a><p>It is possible to add new genomes without recomputing 
        the all-against-all phase for pre-existing genomes. To do so, simply
        add the new fasta databases in the DB/ directory and re-run OMA.
        Likewise, it is possible to update a genome by deleting the old genome
        from the DB/ directory, and adding a new file. <b>Important: </b>
to avoid clashes with previously computed results, the updated genome 
        must use a different filename than any previously computed 
        result.</p>
<a name="exported"><h2>Exporting precomputed all-against-all</h2>
</a><p>Additionally it is possible to export the precomputed
        all-against-all for any of the >2000 genomes currently in the oma database.
        This can result in a massive speedup of time to run omastandalone. To export
        genomes, go to <a href="https://omabrowser.org/export">https://omabrowser.org/export</a> and select the genomes you
        wish to include in your omastandalone run. The resulting compressed tar file
        should be downloaded and uncompressed in the root directory of your analysis. 
        Then simply run omastandalone as normal.</p>
<a name="advanced optimisations"><h2>Advanced usages of OMA standalone</h2>
</a><p>In this section we collect a few ideas to push the limits of 
        OMA standalone.</p>
<a name="maximum time"><h3>Specifying the maximum amount of computing time</h3>
</a><p>Often it is desirable to have many short jobs than a few
        long running ones, especially in a HPC environment. There, usually each
        job is limited to a certain amount of time, where short jobs usually 
        get a higher priority assigned. With the <tt>-W</tt>
 command line 
        option, one can inform OMA of the maximum amount of time (in seconds) it should use
        before exiting in a clean way. Once this time limit is reached, OMA terminates
        with an exit value of 99, which can be used on many schedulers to re-queue the job
        automatically. On LSF, you can use for example -Q "99", SGE (if not deactivated
        by the cluster configurations) will reschedule jobs automatically. The <b>exit code has changed in release 2.3</b>
 in order to support the
        SGE platform more easily.</p>
<p>Sensible values for <tt>-W</tt>
 are usually between 3600
        (1 hour) or higher. Note that this flag does not replace any resource
        allocation option from the scheduler.</p>
<a name="utils"><h1>Utility tools</h1>
</a><p>OMA standalone ships with a few additional utility tools 
        to simplify working with OMA. We briefly introduce them here. All tools 
        are shell script located in OMA's bin directory. All tools provide some
        additional help information with the command line option <tt>-h</tt>
</p>
<a name="cleanup"><h2>oma-cleanup</h2>
</a><p>In case a few processes to compute the all-vs-all get 
        prematurly terminated or killed for whatever reason, they usually leave
        back lock files that need to be removed. <pre>oma-cleanup</pre>
 is 
        a simple shell script that removes all of the lock files. Before using
        this tool, make sure that no OMA process is still running.</p>
<a name="status"><h2>oma-status</h2>
</a><p>The parallel all-vs-all phase of OMA standalone can take 
        quite a lot of time to compute and for the process themselves it is rather
        difficult to estimate how far the overall progress advanced already. We 
        therefore provide a tool that reports the overall progress of the all-vs-all
        phase with the following command: <pre>oma-status</pre>
Note also the 
        command line options of the tool that can give you extended reporting,
        parallel calculations, etc. You can run <tt>oma-status</tt>
 also while
        computations are still ongoing.</p>
<a name="compact"><h2>oma-compact</h2>
</a><p>The all-vs-all phase can produce a huge amount of files, 
        specially for big genomes. On many HPC clusters users have restrictions
        on the number of files that can be stored. <tt>oma-compact</tt>

        utility tool that will compact the Cache/AllAll directory of finished 
        genome pairs to just a single file per pair:<pre>oma-compact</pre>

<a name="applications"><h1>Applications for OMA standalone</h1>
</a><p>In this section we provide a few hints on best practices 
          on how to use OMA standalone results in possible applications.</p>
<a name="speciestreeinference"><h2>Species tree reconstruction</h2>
</a><p>The most common approach to reconstruct a species 
          phylogeny is to build a supermatrix from many marker loci. For this
          it is of outmost importance to avoid paralogous relations within each
          loci. OMA Groups (or simply Orthologous Groups) is the most suitable 
          type of output. Each group forms a maximum clique in the graph of 
          pairwise orthologs. OMA standalone builds a directory called <i>OrthologousGroupsFasta</i>
, that contains for each group
          a fasta formatted file with their unaligned sequences.</p>
<p>A standard approach would therefore be to build a MSA 
          for each of the marker gene groups, concatenate them and infer an tree 
          from the superalignment.</p>
<a name="functionpredict"><h2>Predict gene functions of a new genome</h2>
</a><p>OMA can be used to annotate the function of proteins from 
          a new genome / proteome using existing gene ontology annotations from 
          other species in OMA. OMA propagates annotations based on shared OMA 
          group membership - the details are explained in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gku1158">this paper</a>. For this to work, you need to export a few relevant and well annotated
          genomes from the OMA Browser. By adding your own proteome to the dataset,
          and running OMA standalone, your output directory will eventually contain a gaf 
          formatted annotations file named <i>gene_function.gaf</i>
.</p>
<p>As not all annotation terms make sense in all domains
          of life, the parameter <tt>CladeDefinition</tt>
 can be used to limit 
          the propagation to the certain parts of the tree of life.</p>
<a name="evolanalysis"><h2>Dynamics of Genome Evolution</h2>
</a><p>The Hierarchical Orthologous Groups (HOGs) of OMA capture
          the dynamics of genome evolution, i.e. the joint evolutionary events
          acting on the set of species under consideration. The model of OMA tries 
          to explain the evolutionary history using speciations, duplications 
          and losses. HOGs are groups of genes that descended from a single 
          ancestral gene at a specific taxonomic level. OMA standalone will 
          computed these nested groups and store them in the community standard <a href="http://www.orthoxml.org/">OrthoXML</a> format. The output file is called <i>HierarchicalGroups.orthoxml</i>
.</p>
<p>The root-level grouping provides something similar as a 
          homologous group. As this specific grouping can be useful in itself,
          OMA standalone produces for each root-level HOG a fasta file in a 
          subdirectory named <i>HOGFasta</i>
.</p>
<p>For more complicated analyses of the evolutionary dynamics, 
          extracting groups at specific taxonomic levels, creating a phylostratetic 
          analysis and many more things, we developed the special purpose tool <a href="https://github.com/DessimozLab/pyham">pyHAM</a> to work with orthoxml files.</p>
<a name="phylogeneticprofiling"><h2>Phylogenetic Profiling</h2>
</a><p>Orthology is also used to build phylogenetic profiling—patterns
          of presence and absence of genes across species. OMA standalone produces
          two forms of output: a binary matrix with species as rows and OMA
          groups as columns, indicating patterns of presence or absence of genes in each
          group; a count matrix with species as columns and HOGs as rows, indicating the
          number of genes in each HOG. Phylogenetic profiling tools can help to 
          identify from this information proteins that are involved in the same 
          biological pathway.</p>
<a name="fileformats"><h1>File Formats</h1>
</a><a name="iformat"><h2>Input Files</h2>
</a><p>OMA uses two different input formats: FASTA files for 
            genome input and a Darwin file for parameter input.</p>
<p>The Fasta format is explained in detail on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format">wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>As almost everywhere else, OMA uses the greater-than 
            symbol ">" to distinguish labels from sequences. Each sequence 
            in a genome is supposed to have its own label. Have a look at the 
            FASTA files included in ToyExample/DB in our installer package for 
            some example files. The fasta genome files need to have a "<tt>.fa</tt>
" extension to be recognised as such.</p>
<p>In case your genomes contain multiple alternative 
            splicing variants, you can add a text-based file per genome called <tt>DB/{YourGenome}.splice</tt>
 that put together the different
            splicing variants, e.g. to indicate that the three splicing variants
            ENSP00000384207, ENSP00000263741 and ENSP00000353094 are encoded by the 
            same gene, add the following line to the splice file:</p>
<p><pre>ENSP00000384207; ENSP00000263741; ENSP00000353094</pre>
OMA requires that the individual IDs are unique prefixes of your 
            FASTA headers.</p>
<p>Poor quality genomes often suffer from truncated gene 
            models. If you name the FASTA files of poor quality genomes <tt>{YourGenome}.contig.fa</tt>
, they are treated specially: OMA will
            ignore the <a href="#parameters"><tt>LengthTol</tt>
</a>condition, such that orthology will also be established for 
            non-full-length homologous pairs, i.e. the condition that the 
            fraction of the length of the effective pairwise alignment 
            divided by the length of the shorter sequences must be at least <tt>LengthTol</tt>
 is ignored. For ESPRIT, genomes labeled 
            with the <tt>.contig.fa</tt>
 extension are considered for 
            searching for split genes.</p>
<p>Parameter files use Darwin syntax.  Key-value-pairs 
            are written as</p>
<p><pre>key := value;</pre>
</p>
<p>Note the colon in <tt>:=</tt>
 and the semicolon at 
            the end of the line. If your parameter file does not use valid 
            Darwin syntax, OMA will print out a short message and stop its 
            execution.</p>
<a name="oformat"><h2>OMA Output Files</h2>
</a><p>The output of OMA gets written to files stored in a 
            directory <tt>Output</tt>
 in your working directory. This can 
            be changed by changing the <tt>OutputFolder</tt>
 parameter, 
            There are text files and directories organized as described in 
            Table 1. If not all output files are needed, note that the 
            production of some of them can be disabled (see Table 4 below).</p>

<a name="parameters"><h1>Parameters</h1>
</a><p>All parameters for OMA and ESPRIT are
                set in a parameters file. There is an example file in the
                OMA installer package; we encourage you to copy this file
                into your working directory and change it to your needs, or use
                the command <tt>OMA -p</tt>
 to create a default parameters 
                file.</p>
<p>The parameter file consists of three main parts:
                First, general parameters for OMA are set. Table 3 describes 
                these parameters in detail.</p>
<p>Next, there are a few optional
                parameters, listed in Table 4, to avoid producing particular 
                output files. Indeed, in large analyses, disabling the 
                generation of unused output might save a substantial amount of 
                computing time and might drastically reduce the number of 
                produced files. </p>
<p>The third part are the parameters which are unique
                to ESPRIT. Check the <a href="#esprit">ESPRIT section</a> for details on them.</p>

<a name="esprit"><h1>ESPRIT</h1>
</a><p>ESPRIT can be used to identify split genes in low 
           quality genomes. In essense, it tries to find gene fragments in genomes 
           named <tt>{YourGenome}.contig.fa</tt>
 that when combined, exists as 
           a full length gene in other genomes. See <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbr038">http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbr038</a> for details on the methodology. </p>
<a name="espritparams"><h2>Esprit Parameters</h2>
</a><p>ESPRIT also needs to operate on computed all-vs-all 
           alignments. It therefore shares all the parameters from OMA that

, <tt>AlignBatchSize</tt>
, <tt>MinScore</tt>
, <tt>MinSeqLen</tt>
, and <tt>LengthTol</tt>
.</p>
<p>The more specific parameters that only 
           affect the ESPRIT algorithm are explained in Table 5.  Note that
           changing the ESPRIT parameters will not have an effect unless you
