# SalmoNet2
The public repository of the SalmoNet2 resource.

The guide folder refers to one of our workflows detailing how to create custom interaction networks with the same approach we have used in this project. 

The permanova folder contains the input files and scripts used for the permanova analysis of interaction layers and core genome SNP based phylogeny.
